He can direct the new person on what to do.  We need help every day probably though March but any days covered helps.  Horse experience is helpful but not necessary. Every morning we refill water buckets for horses staying in( when it is too cold, windy, or stormy to go out).  We distribute hay and grain to approximately 30 rescue horses awaiting adoption, being rehabilitated, or in sanctuary care.  Some horses are haltered and led out into the pastures.  Other horses run out of their stalls to their pastures and we just need to open their stall doors. If you have a morning free, think about the benefits of helping S.H.A.R.E. by committing an hour and a half to doing morning chores.  It will get you up and outside to start the day.  You feel good afterwards about helping a good cause.  You don't have to have horse experience to be of help.  If interested in volunteering, contact the volunteer coordinator, Heide at heidefogal@aol.com or call the Kim at 217-649-3232."
